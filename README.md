The two csv's comparing are named prev.csv (previous) and curr.csv (current)

PreReqs:
  1. Python3.x
  2. Makes sure pandas is installed on whatever python version you are running
  3. A curr.csv file

Option 1: Just have a .curr file in a directory of choice
  - Go into the main file and change the path to point to that directory 
  - Go into the main file and change the columns of the csv file
  - Then run the main.py file (Some packages might have to be installed)
  
Option 2: Have both a .prev file and .curr file in a directory of choice
  - Go into the main file and change the path to point to that directory
