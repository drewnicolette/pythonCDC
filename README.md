# pythonCDC
This repository does a CDC on two .csv files

The two csv's comparing are named prev.csv (previous) and curr.csv (current)

1. Clone the repo
2. You can initialize it by pointing to the directory where you keep your files
  - This project looks for prev.csv and .curr files

Option 1: Just have a .curr file in a directory of choice
  - Go into the main file and change the path to point to that directory 
  - Go into the main file and change the columns of the csv file
  - Then run the main.py file (Some packages might have to be installed)
