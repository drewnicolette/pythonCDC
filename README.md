1. Clone the repoa
2. You can initialize it by pointing to the directory where you keep your files
  - This project looks for .prev and .curr files

Option 1: Just have a .curr file in a directory of choice
  - Go into the main file and change the path to point to that directory 
  - Go into the main file and change the columns of the csv file
  - Then run the main.py file (Some packages might have to be installed)
